<h3 id="staff-bereavement-groups">Staff Bereavement Groups</h3>
<p>During the Coronavirus pandemic, there has been few families, friends, colleagues that have not been affected. Especially at a time when front line staff, within the NHS, Local Authority, and Teaching profession have felt an enormous pressure to be resilient.  Everyone within these groups are under enormous pressure to continue to perform at the highest of standard, at one of the most unprecedent time that we have seen as a country, world.</p>
<p>Yet, it is these very groups of people that have been feeling vulnerable, either due to a personal death or seen death in a way they never anticipated they would have to. Whilst the personal effect of such devastation can vary between individuals, the impact of such pressure and experiences can have detrimental lasting impacts.</p>
<p>Bereavement groups are open to any staff groups who would find it supportive and helpful.  Small staff bereavement groups were set up online through Zoom where staff can collectively mourn a colleague or friend together in a virtual world.</p>
<p>Being provided with the ability to see each other and talk through the loss the sadness, frustrations, and anger in a supportive group environment rather than alone has been immensely powerful for staff. This acts as a holding group until people can see each other in person to acknowledge their grief, and to come together to mourn or celebrate the person’s life.</p>
<p>In some groups there are more questions than answers particularly where staff are working with children where there has been a death of a parent or close family member death.  The group had the opportunity to talk of their own shock and grief as well as worries of being a parent themselves and the impact that this could have on their own families. By exploring their own fears and vulnerabilities people have been able to think and discuss a range of topics from their professional role and responsibilities to the children, families and patients in their care.</p>
<p>As a group they were able to think and reflect together and talk of the need of the child and family as they began to explore the practical and emotional support and services that would be  needed to be in place for children and families.</p>
<p>Staff feedback comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>I felt so alone before the group.</li>
<li>It’s good to be able to cry together.</li>
<li>I am so angry but now understand that is ok.</li>
<li>Bloody Corvid!!!.</li>
<li>It’s good to be able to talk about how to support a child who has lost a parent.</li>
<li>I am still trying to process all this death, but I know I am not alone, but I do feel so sad.</li>
<li>I am so angry that another frontline BAME staff has died but this one was my friend. I am so glad we had the group today I was not looking forward to this group today but found it so helpful.</li>
<li>I loved the virtual group hug at the end, but I cannot wait to give everyone a real hug.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="space-to-talk-for-staff-groups">Space to Talk for Staff Groups</h3>
<p>‘Space to Talk’ was developed  as a result of a discussion with a group of Directors who are creative thinkers from a large organisation where they were looking to offer support to front line staff groups in a supportive group environment.  I raised the idea of ‘Space to Talk’, that differs from other kinds of staff support, such as reflective practice. Space to Talk offers both psychological support for staff wellbeing as well as a space to reflect and think.</p>
<p>With ‘Space to Talk’ staff have an opportunity to talk openly in a confidential space with colleagues and are encouraged to think creatively and collectively in order for the group to find solutions to concerns raised. The group learn to reframe their thinking, and to reflect on their work practices and that of the organisation they work in.</p>
<p>Where a group solution cannot be found  the group can alternatively be  used to channel questions to the management of the organisation in order to achieve a clearer understanding and make management aware of any staff concerns and issues that  are raised as a group rather than an  individual. This enables staff to express their views in a non-threating forum and approach management through the facilitator, when requested by the group, which management had agreed to.</p>
<p>During the Coronavirus peak staff used ‘Space to Talk’ to express many personal and professional concerns and anxieties, including their worries and fears of being BAME front line staff , the apprehension of returning to work, concerns of their own families, working from home and achieving a  work life balance.</p>
<p>A staff survey recently asked how helpful ‘Space to Talk’ had been during this difficult time. 60 staff members responded to the survey with 100% saying that this had been ‘very supportive’ and a helpful resource’ and wanted ‘Space to Talk’ to be continued in their daily working practice as it had done pre Covid-19.</p>
<p>Staff groups that participated in ‘Space to Talk’ are the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Front line staff</li>
<li>Health Visitors</li>
<li>Nurses</li>
<li>School Health staff groups</li>
<li>Teachers</li>
</ul>
