                <div class="item item-two">
                        <p>I am a freelance consultant who has set up Core Reflections a consultancy company which supports   organisations with sustainable, value driven transformational changes. In addition to offering wellbeing services for staff groups and individuals and support services to organisations. I have been working with organisations to develop a shared core belief, be creative thinkers, develop business strategies and create shared values. This has in some cases led to a more entrepreneurial leadership which on evaluation has resulted in staff feeling more involved, appreciated and respected</p>
<p>I have 29 years of experience of working within the NHS in a Psychology/Counselling service in a Primary Care trust in East London where I was a Consultant Clinical Counsellor specialising in the physical and mental health fields. In 2013 the service became a Social Enterprise where I became one of the founding Directors, until 2018.</p>
<p>Before my NHS role I worked as a Youth and Community worker in supporting children, families and young people within their communities to thrive alongside mentoring young people to achieve their aspirations. I have been fortunate enough to have worked with a wide group of young people including young people at risk, youth offenders and supporting people in prisons. Deaf and disabled young adults.</p>
<p>I grew up in East London where I continue to live and work.  I am passionate about challenging health and social inequalities.</p>

<p>My work practice demonstrates my belief in co-production. I have developed and delivered multiple services across health, and voluntary organisations within clinical and non-clinical services. Ensuring services are relevant, needed and respond to local need.</p>
<p>Core Reflections offers an accessible service including British Sign Language access to Deaf community members.</p>

        <h3>My Ethos</h3>

        <p>Any work undertaken by Core Reflections is conducted with an ethos of respect, which is a belief I have
            carried
            with me throughout my working career.</p>
        <p>This ethos represents the important idea that everyone has something important and valuable to offer, thus
            every
            person should be respected as such.</p>


        <p>This encompasses the belief that services should be accessible for everyone and anything is possible if we
            support each other.</p>

                <p>I have worked with Pauline as my one-to-one clinical supervisor for a number of years as part of my practice as a self-employed psychotherapist.</p>
                   <h4> Quality of the supervision</h4>
<p>Pauline is a very highly experienced therapist and supervisor and provides very high-quality supervision. She is highly reflective and is a very supportive presence. She has a particular strength in tuning in to the experience and needs of the clients I have discussed with her and is also very skilled in helping me to reflect on my own countertransference towards clients.</p>                    
                    <h4>Professionalism</h4>
                    <p>Pauline is very professional and is clear in her boundaries and agreements in relation to booking times, payments, managing confidentiality, etc.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Overall feeling of supervision.</h4>
                    <p>Overall, my feeling is that Pauline is a very grounding and supportive supervisor. I am comfortable that she will treat any questions or uncertainties I might share with her without judgment and will work through any issues I may be struggling with as a colleague and peer. Coming away from a session with Pauline, I always feel as though I have had an opportunity to explore what I needed to in depth, allowing me to support my clients with more confidence. I also feel as though she has invested a great deal of reflection and consideration in understanding my strengths as a therapist and areas where I might benefit from guidance.</p>
                    <h4>Support outside the clinical supervision sessions.</h4>
                    <p>
                    Pauline helpfully makes herself available in the case of any immediate pressing concerns or emergencies relating to client care. If I have an issue I would like to get guidance from her about at short notice, I know that I can contact her to organize a call and that she will find a space to speak to me as soon as possible.</p>

                <p>Working with Pauline in supervision had always been positive because we are able to communicate in British Sign Language which is my first language and she is able to understand my feelings/thoughts especially in the minority community I worked & lived in.</p>
<p>Sometimes working in different cultural ad language minority groups can be challenging. Pauline is able to cross any barriers with personal understanding and professional skill as a clinical supervisor.</p>

                <p>Pauline has helped us with complex and sensitive staff situations. She has a really practical
                    down-to-earth approach which has resulted in measurable improvements that have meant better
                    relationships between staff and less management time spent trying to solve problems.</p>
                <p>Pauline has provided mediation and also bespoke communication interventions where she has taken time
                    to understand the individuals’ issues and to make a plan to help them refocus on the work they are
                    doing and less on the personal matters which frustrate them.</p>
                <p>Pauline is easy to talk to and understanding. She gets to the heart of a problem and cuts through the
                    waffle!</p>

                <p>I was in a dark place tried Counselling before but I felt I didn’t fit in and it was over for me
                    after a couple of sessions.
                </p>
                <p>Then I meet Pauline after Counselling sessions with her, this lady changed my life and I could see a
                    light at the end of the tunnel. I suffered a lot of trauma and pain, my heart was aching through the
                    anxiety and stress of everything I had experienced. She gave me tools to cope and words that I will
                    never forget.</p>

                <p>I’m so thankful for this amazing lady that I’m still here today to write this.</p>

                <p>We wanted to offer wellbeing support to people taking part in online creative workshops as we knew
                    that the subject matter was very personal and potentially emotionally triggering. This was
                    especially the case with sessions taking place online during a series of national lockdowns. Pauline
                    was incredibly helpful and supportive in talking through the best way to support those taking part,
                    and very flexible in the support she was able to offer. At the forefront was a deep understanding
                    and care for individuals going through extremely difficult changes in their lives, which gave us the
                    confidence to trust that we were working with the right person to support them. We would definitely
                    look to work with Pauline again in the future, and would recommend anyone running a similar project
                    take up similar advice and wellbeing support for the people they are working with.</p>
