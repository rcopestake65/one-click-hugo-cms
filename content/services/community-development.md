## Community Development

Community Development is a powerful tool to support and work with local groups of people to effect social change. For example when crisis/ issues has affected or impacted on their lives, and their community in some way. By encouraging people to actively take part in a group and to work together  they can feel empowered; they will find a shared voice and feel they are being listened to, and importantly that their opinions matter. Depending on the circumstances community groups can influence both local and national thinking, and policy .

Community development is about creating space and opportunities where people are encouraged to actively come together as a group to identify those issues and to feel part of a decision making process . This way of working not only benefits the local community but the people themselves, as they will feel valued and have a new found shared confidence.

The role of the Community Development facilitator is to support and encourage people to find their voice to support their participation and enable the group to develop, share ideas, and concerns in order for change to occur. By bringing together the local community, policy makers, services, organisations to work together to agree the best outcome for all parties.

Some examples, of those who have benefited from this type of facilitation are; local Community groups, marginalised groups, Tenants Association, Residents from a Local council estate.
