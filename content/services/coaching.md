## Coaching

People seeking coaching are usually Managers, Directors, CEOs or Team leaders. Although this can be expanded to other management positions.

This usually takes place between two people the Coach and the professional, who has requested support with their work/ organisation/ staff member/team etc.

The Coach’s role is to enable the professional to be listened too, and allow discussion to take place , in some instances the Coach may observe a situation.
The role of the Coach is to support critical and creative thinking to ensure the professional reaches their full potential.

The Coach can help the professional to develop realistic goals/aims for their organisation/or team. Then this can be worked through in the coaching sessions which is often task based.

By encouraging creative thinking, working on the professional’s own goals, solutions and ideas this can lead to both organisational change as well as strengthen personal development. Coaching complements and builds on the professional’s own chosen goals, and reinforce these ideas by providing and an enriching coaching experience.
