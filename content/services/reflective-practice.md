## Reflective Practice

Reflective Practice offers a wide range of staff groups/managers the opportunity to take time out of a busy pressurised working week to be able to think and reflect about the work they do, and their role. Different staff groups will have different needs; thus, the initial meeting will determine what these needs are. Staff groups come from a range of professions, which include health, social care, Voluntary sector, Local Authority.

A few examples of topics for discussion are the following:

- Clinical work
- Organisational issues
- Working in a team
- Team cohesiveness
- Understanding team responses
- Working with difficult clients/service users/ organisation’s.
- Managing a crisis
- Developing good management techniques

The opportunities provided by reflective practice are designed to engage staff in a process of thinking. Thus allowing the group to discuss a range of topics, expand on work practice and to be open with each other. This involves taking the time to think, reflect, and consider the work in detail, share both professional practice and information; enabling us to understand what makes good and bad practice. Furthermore, during the sessions, there will be times where the group can discuss and open up about what we struggle with; such as the work we do, the impact the work has upon our professional practice, the effect on our daily working lives and struggle to find motivation. All of these issues can surface during Reflective practice sessions.
The benefits of Reflective Practice

The skills we work on during our sessions, and the activities conducted, can be a catalyst for the enhancement of individual practice. Through engaging with an array of different points of view in order to improve our ability to analyse the work we do in detail, we can sufficiently build the foundations required to improve and assess present practice techniques and allow teams to cooperate and work in cohesion with each other and increase their self-awareness of their working practice. The result of such work is staff therefore feel listened to, supported and the motivation that they may have struggled with before begins to increase. The ability to observe and analyse different points of view, assess their own skills and the support needed in order for both them and the team to grow can ultimately lead to a sense of community and care within the work place.
Methodology

Within these reflective practice sessions, there is a facilitator present, whose role is to ensure staff groups not only feel safe and secure enough to be able to take part in discussions, but are given the space and time in order to do so.

All discussions presented are designed to encourage engagement from every team member, which allows the individuals to begin analysing their own thoughts on a particular matter and thus present and share their points of view. The result is a team, whom are discussing and analysing a wide array of different perspectives that perhaps would not have been offered previously.

The topics which are discussed within these groups are topics that have previously been agreed upon; these can translate during the sessions as different scenarios or cases which are presented to the group. The materials required for these discussions to take place are usually brought by staff members, as mentioned before, since every staff member is unique, and subsequently each discussion itself bringing new and unique perspectives, it is important the these materials are provided by staff themselves.
