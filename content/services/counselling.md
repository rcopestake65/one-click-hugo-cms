## Counselling

Counselling is known as talking therapy or signing therapy if you are a Deaf/BSL user.   It is face to face therapy delivered in a secure trusting relationship between Counsellor and client in a safe environment.

People will often seek therapy for different reasons some examples are when they are experiencing one or more of the following:

- Coping with a long-term health condition.
- End of life
- Trauma
- Bereavement
- Relationship issues
- Harassment and bullying issues.
- Low self esteem
- Stress
- Anxiety
- Becoming a carer / caring issues.
- Parents with children with Disabilities
- Dealing with life changes e.g. divorce, imprisonment

Counselling aims are to have a positive impact in supporting people’s emotional, physical and psychological wellbeing. The purpose of Counselling is to offer a therapeutic thinking and listening space to the client.

The Counsellor does not offer advice or opinion or direct the client in what they should do.   The Counsellor and client have a “talking /signing space” in which to identify and come to an understanding of the difficulties that the client is experiencing which is impacting on their life and their day to day living.

In most cases the client has a weekly counselling session.   During the first few sessions the Counsellor will make an assessment of the concerns and a mutual agreement then takes place between Counsellor and client on agreed goals, objectives, and the amount of therapy needed. Some people may need or choose short term counselling which could be a few months while others need more long-term Counselling.

The outcome of counselling is that the client will be able to make the desired changes to their lives by what they have gained and experienced in their counselling sessions.   They will have developed a more constructive understanding of the issues they were dealing/facing and will be able to build upon what they have gained through therapy to increase their confidence and inner strength and to face any future concerns in a more constructive way.
