{{< about-section-one >}}

I am a freelance consultant who has set up Core Reflections a consultancy company which supports   organisations with sustainable, value driven transformational changes. In addition to offering wellbeing services for staff groups and individuals and support services to organisations. I have been working with organisations to develop a shared core belief, be creative thinkers, develop business strategies and create shared values. This has in some cases led to a more entrepreneurial leadership which on evaluation has resulted in staff feeling more involved, appreciated and respected

I have 29 years of experience of working within the NHS in a Psychology/Counselling service in a Primary Care trust in East London where I was a Consultant Clinical Counsellor specialising in the physical and mental health fields. In 2013 the service became a Social Enterprise where I became one of the founding Directors, until 2018.

Before my NHS role I worked as a Youth and Community worker in supporting children, families and young people within their communities to thrive alongside mentoring young people to achieve their aspirations. I have been fortunate enough to have worked with a wide group of young people including young people at risk, youth offenders and supporting people in prisons. Deaf and disabled young adults.

I grew up in East London where I continue to live and work.  I am passionate about challenging health and social inequalities.

My work practice demonstrates my belief in co-production. I have developed and delivered multiple services across health, and voluntary organisations within clinical and non-clinical services. Ensuring services are relevant, needed and respond to local need.

Core Reflections offers an accessible service including British Sign Language access to Deaf community members.
