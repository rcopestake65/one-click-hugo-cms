    <h2 id="mediation">Mediation</h2>
<p>A Mediator is required to assist a specific situation around conflict in the work place.   This may occur when someone raises a complaint, or concerns about the way they feel they are being treated for example by a work colleagues, or a Line manager, or there may be a  culture clash such as a dispute between staff members, or harassment and bullying or an organisation change that requires mediation to help that change.</p>
<p>A Mediator will have an impartial, independent, non- judgemental role. The role and purpose of the Mediator is to support and assist in initiating a dialogue between the affected parties involved in the dispute in a secure supportive environment. This may be done over several meetings that will enable assessment of the conflict and concerns that have been raised in order to reach the best solution for all parties.</p>
<p>Depending on the outcome, in a few rare instances, the Mediator may suggest a more formal route that may be required to consider in resolving the matter and reach the best result.  Suggestions will be offered by the Mediator as a way of moving forward which can result in a more productive way of staff working together.  The overriding aim would always be in the best interest of all the effective parties to seek a satisfactory resolution.<br>
