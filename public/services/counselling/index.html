<p>Counselling is known as talking therapy or signing therapy if you are a Deaf/BSL user.   It is face to face therapy delivered in a secure trusting relationship between Counsellor and client in a safe environment.</p>
<p>People will often seek therapy for different reasons some examples are when they are experiencing one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coping with a long-term health condition.</li>
<li>End of life</li>
<li>Trauma</li>
<li>Bereavement</li>
<li>Relationship issues</li>
<li>Harassment and bullying issues.</li>
<li>Low self esteem</li>
<li>Stress</li>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Becoming a carer / caring issues.</li>
<li>Parents with children with Disabilities</li>
<li>Dealing with life changes e.g. divorce, imprisonment</li>
</ul>
<p>Counselling aims are to have a positive impact in supporting people’s emotional, physical and psychological wellbeing. The purpose of Counselling is to offer a therapeutic thinking and listening space to the client.</p>
<p>The Counsellor does not offer advice or opinion or direct the client in what they should do.   The Counsellor and client have a “talking /signing space” in which to identify and come to an understanding of the difficulties that the client is experiencing which is impacting on their life and their day to day living.</p>
<p>In most cases the client has a weekly counselling session.   During the first few sessions the Counsellor will make an assessment of the concerns and a mutual agreement then takes place between Counsellor and client on agreed goals, objectives, and the amount of therapy needed. Some people may need or choose short term counselling which could be a few months while others need more long-term Counselling.</p>
<p>The outcome of counselling is that the client will be able to make the desired changes to their lives by what they have gained and experienced in their counselling sessions.   They will have developed a more constructive understanding of the issues they were dealing/facing and will be able to build upon what they have gained through therapy to increase their confidence and inner strength and to face any future concerns in a more constructive way.</p>

<p><em>Counselling has had such a positive effect on my life, this has been so helpful.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you.</em></p>
<p><em>I have such a better understanding of what happened to me and why. I was such an angry person, I still have down days but I understand why and am not frightened of my negative thoughts.</em></p>
<p><em>I met Pauline O’Halloran, a few years ago when I hit a very painful and traumatic time in my life. At the first instance I didn’t want to go to see anybody, and from day one of seeing Pauline for counselling.I knew I was in the right place and had meet the amazing lady who has now bought me to place in my life that I could never dream of reaching. Pauline gave me the tools, confidence, and self belief that I had lost in my emotions and pain. I felt like I was a closed shell that would never open again. With my time with Pauline she gently with her caring way got me to open it. I will never forget my time that I spend with Pauline. She got me to see the light at the end of a long dark tunnel.  I could never thank her enough.</em></p>
